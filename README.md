Introduction:
Sales prediction is a critical aspect of business strategy and planning. Accurate sales forecasts enable businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, staffing, budgeting, and marketing. This project aims to predict future sales based on historical data, using various machine learning techniques.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast sales for a given product, store, or time period. The model will be trained on historical sales data and will learn to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make accurate predictions.

Dataset:
Features:

Date: The specific date of the sales record.
Store: The identifier for the store where the sales occurred.
Product: The identifier for the product sold.
Promotion: Whether a promotion was active during the sales period.
Holiday: Indicator for whether the sales date falls on a holiday.
Weather: Weather conditions on the sales date (e.g., sunny, rainy).
Price: The price of the product during the sales period.
Economic Indicators: Additional factors like inflation rate, unemployment rate, etc.
Target:

Sales: The number of units sold or total revenue generated.
Methodology:
Data Collection:

Gather historical sales data, including relevant features such as date, store, product, price, and promotions.
Collect additional external data that might influence sales, such as economic indicators and weather data.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Convert categorical variables (e.g., store, product, weather) into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalize or scale numerical features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.
Create new features, such as rolling averages of sales, to capture trends over time.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of sales over time, identifying any seasonal trends or cyclic patterns.
Analyze the impact of various features (e.g., promotions, holidays, price) on sales through correlation matrices, scatter plots, and bar charts.
Use time series analysis techniques to decompose sales data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.
Implement and compare different regression models:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
XGBoost
LSTM (for time series forecasting)
Tune hyperparameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability to unseen data.
Analyze residuals to understand the difference between actual and predicted sales.
Forecasting:

Use the best-performing model to make future sales predictions.
Visualize predicted sales against actual sales to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
Perform scenario analysis to predict sales under different conditions (e.g., with/without promotions, during holidays).
Result Analysis:

Discuss the results and identify which features are most important in predicting sales.
Provide actionable insights based on the model's predictions, such as optimal pricing strategies or the best times to run promotions.
Conclusion:
The project will conclude with a summary of the findings, including the best-performing model for sales prediction and its practical implications for business decision-making. The project will also provide recommendations for improving sales forecasts, such as incorporating more features or using advanced forecasting techniques.

Tools & Technologies:
